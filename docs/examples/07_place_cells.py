# # ## Phase precession
# #
# # In addition to place modulation, place cells are also modulated by the theta oscillation. The phase at which neurons fire is dependant of the position. This phenomen is called "phase precession" (see [J. O’Keefe, M. L. Recce, "Phase relationship between hippocampal place units and the EEG theta rhythm." Hippocampus 3, 317–330 (1993).](https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.450030307)
# #
# # Let's compute the response of the neuron as a function of both theta and position. The phase of theta has already been computed but we have to bring it to the same dimension as the position feature. While the position has been sampled at 40Hz, the theta phase has been computed at 1250Hz.
# # Later on during the analysis, we will use a bin size of 5 ms for counting the spikes. Since this corresponds to an intermediate frequency between 40 and 1250 Hz, we will bring all the features to 200Hz already.

# bin_size = 0.005

# theta = theta.bin_average(bin_size, position.time_support)
# theta = (theta + 2 * np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)

# data = nap.TsdFrame(
#     t=theta.t,
#     d=np.vstack(

#     ).T,
#     time_support=position.time_support,
#     columns=["position", "theta"],
# )

# print(data)





# # %%
# # `data` is a `TsdFrame` that contains the position and phase. Before calling `compute_2d_tuning_curves` from pynapple to observe the theta phase precession, we will restrict the analysis to the place field of one neuron. 
# #
# # There are a lot of neurons but for this analysis, we will focus on one neuron only.

# # %%
# # This neurons place field is between 0 and 60 cm within the linear track. Here we will use the `threshold` function of pynapple to quickly compute the epochs for which the animal is within the place field :

# within_ep = position.threshold(60.0, method="below").time_support

# # %%
# # `within_ep` is an `IntervalSet`. We can now give it to `compute_2d_tuning_curves` along with the spiking activity and the position-phase features.

# tc_pos_theta, xybins = nap.compute_2d_tuning_curves(spikes, data, 20, within_ep)

# # %%
# # To show the theta phase precession, we can also display the spike as a function of both position and theta. In this case, we use the function `value_from` from pynapple.

# theta_pos_spikes = spikes[neuron].value_from(data, ep = within_ep)

# # %%
# # Now we can plot everything together :

# plt.fill_between(pf[neuron].index.values, np.zeros(len(pf)), pf[neuron].values)

# plt.xlabel("Position (cm)")
# plt.ylabel("Theta Phase (rad)")

# plt.subplot(gs[1, 1])
# plt.plot(theta_pos_spikes["position"], theta_pos_spikes["theta"], "o", markersize=0.5)
# plt.xlabel("Position (cm)")
# plt.ylabel("Theta Phase (rad)")

# plt.tight_layout()

# # %%
# # ## Speed modulation
# # The speed at which the animal traverse the field is not homogeneous. Does it influence the firing rate of hippocampal neurons? We can compute tuning curves for speed as well as average speed across the maze.
# # In the next block, we compute the speed of the animal for each epoch (i.e. crossing of the linear track) by doing the difference of two consecutive position multiplied by the sampling rate of the position.

# speed = []
# for s, e in data.time_support.values: # Time support contains the epochs
#     pos_ep = data["position"].get(s, e)
#     speed_ep = np.abs(np.diff(pos_ep)) # Absolute difference of two consecutive points
#     speed_ep = np.pad(speed_ep, [0, 1], mode="edge") # Adding one point at the end to match the size of the position array
#     speed_ep = speed_ep * data.rate # Converting to cm/s
#     speed.append(speed_ep)

# speed = nap.Tsd(t=data.t, d=np.hstack(speed), time_support=data.time_support)

# # %%
# # Now that we have the speed of the animal, we can compute the tuning curves for speed modulation. Here we call pynapple `compute_1d_tuning_curves`:

# tc_speed = nap.compute_1d_tuning_curves(spikes, speed, 20)

# # %%
# # To assess the variabilty in speed when the animal is travering the linear track, we can compute the average speed and estimate the standard deviation. Here we use numpy only and put the results in a pandas `DataFrame`:

# bins = np.linspace(np.min(data["position"]), np.max(data["position"]), 20)

# idx = np.digitize(data["position"].values, bins)

# mean_speed = np.array([np.mean(speed[idx==i]) for i in np.unique(idx)])
# std_speed = np.array([np.std(speed[idx==i]) for i in np.unique(idx)])

# # %%
# # Here we plot the tuning curve of one neuron for speed as well as the average speed as a function of the animal position

# plt.figure(figsize=(8, 3))
# plt.subplot(121)
# plt.plot(bins, mean_speed)
# plt.fill_between(
#     bins,
#     mean_speed - std_speed,

# plt.title("Neuron {}".format(neuron))
# plt.tight_layout()

# # %%
# # This neurons show a strong modulation of firing rate as a function of speed but we can also notice that the animal, on average, accelerates when travering the field. Is the speed tuning we observe a true modulation or spurious correlation caused by traversing the place field at different speed and for different theta phase? We can use NeMoS to model the activity and give the position, the phase and the speed as input variable.
# #
# # We will use speed, phase and position to model the activity of the neuron.
# # All the feature have already been brought to the same dimension thanks to `pynapple`.

# position = data["position"]
# theta = data["theta"]
# count = spikes[neuron].count(bin_size, data.time_support)

# print(position.shape)
# print(theta.shape)
# print(speed.shape)
# print(count.shape)

# # %%
# # ## Basis evaluation
# #
# # For each feature, we will use a different set of basis :
# #
# #   -   position : `nmo.basis.MSplineBasis`
# #   -   theta phase : `nmo.basis.CyclicBSplineBasis`
# #   -   speed : `nmo.basis.MSplineBasis`

# position_basis = nmo.basis.MSplineBasis(n_basis_funcs=10)
# phase_basis = nmo.basis.CyclicBSplineBasis(n_basis_funcs=12)
# speed_basis = nmo.basis.MSplineBasis(n_basis_funcs=15)

# # %%
# # In addition, we will consider position and phase to be a joint variable. In NeMoS, we can combine basis by multiplying them and adding them. In this case the final basis object for our model can be made in one line :

# basis = position_basis * phase_basis + speed_basis

# # %%
# # The object basis only tell us how each basis covers the feature space. For each timestep, we need to _evaluate_ what are the features value. For that we can call NeMoS basis:

# X = basis(position, theta, speed)

# # %%
# # `X` is our design matrix. For each timestamps, it contains the information about the current position,
# # speed and theta phase of the experiment. Notice how passing a pynapple object to the basis
# # also returns a `pynapple` object.

# print(X)

# # %%
# # ## Model learning
# #
# # We can now use the Poisson GLM from NeMoS to learn the model.

# glm = nmo.glm.GLM(
#     regularizer=nmo.regularizer.UnRegularized("LBFGS", solver_kwargs=dict(tol=10**-12))
# )

# glm.fit(X, count)

# # %%
# # ## Prediction
# #
# # Let's check first if our model can accurately predict the different tuning curves we displayed above. We can use the `predict` function of NeMoS and then compute new tuning curves

# predicted_rate = glm.predict(X) / bin_size

# glm_pf = nap.compute_1d_tuning_curves_continuous(predicted_rate[:, np.newaxis], position, 50)
# glm_pos_theta, xybins = nap.compute_2d_tuning_curves_continuous(
#     predicted_rate[:, np.newaxis], data, 30, ep=within_ep
# )
# glm_speed = nap.compute_1d_tuning_curves_continuous(predicted_rate[:, np.newaxis], speed, 30)
